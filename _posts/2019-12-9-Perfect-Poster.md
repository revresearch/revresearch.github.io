## What is a research poster?
When presenting at a conference or science fair, you’ll often be asked to present your work at a poster session.

Posters serve two distinct purposes: advertisement and visual aid.

Most (reasonable) people, don’t read every poster in a conference. Even at science fairs, judges won’t get to look at every poster and will pick and choose what they examine during their unscheduled time. Your poster should function as an advertisement that attracts people to come and talk to you about your research.

Once they do come to take a look, the poster’s role changes. Instead of an advertisement, it should function as a visual aid for you to help convey your research to the interested party. It should help visualize and back up what you are saying to explain your work. An ideal research poster is one that you’re constantly pointing to while you’re talking.

## Why is it so hard to make a good poster?
If you walk into the average science fair or poster session, you’ll be greeted with rows of researchers awkwardly staring you down. Next to each of them is a massive wall-of-text that attempts to “summarize” their research without compromise.

If you’re interested in the topic and approach one of these posters, you’ll likely have to make awkward conversation with the presenter while trying to make sense of a bunch of tiny text and data tables. Eventually, after asking the presenter multiple questions you may be able to make out what the heck their research is about in the first place.

Bad research posters are an epidemic. In fact, a Google Image search for research poster yields terrible examples as the top results:

Scientific researchers are experts at what they do, but they’re not always the best communicators or designers. For an average researcher, it’s easy to succumb to the urge to fit your entire research paper or thesis into a 4’ x 3’ design, but that’s really not the point of the poster.

## What are the elements of a poster presentation?
Well, the main purpose of a research poster is to advertise your work. In order to do that, people need to understand what your research is about from afar. The title is the best way to convey this information. It should be concise and include keywords that a large portion of your intended audience can resonate with.

## How do you design a poster?
The vast majority of scientific papers are made with Microsoft Powerpoint. While Powerpoint and Google Slides are extremely accessible software platforms, they’re not the best tool for the job.

Making a visually appealing and consistent poster design is a challenge without a tool that lets you quickly and easily add padding, margins, bleeds, vector graphics, and dynamic wrapping. I recommend Adobe InDesign as it’s specifically designed for making printed material and has almost every functionality you can think of when it comes to making a poster.

It does have a bit of a learning curve, though. If you want to learn to use this software, I recommend using my affiliate link to get a 30-day free trial of Skillshare to take the Adobe InDesign - Essentials Training Course from Daniel Scott, a certified InDesign teacher, for free!
